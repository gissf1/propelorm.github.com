# Support #

There are several ways to get help when you are having problems with Propel.


## Gitter ##

Gitter is a instant messaging service allowing you to chat via web interface, [iphone app, native app](https://gitter.im/apps) or [irc client](http://irc.gitter.im).

[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/propelorm/Propel)
 [https://gitter.im/propelorm/Propel](https://gitter.im/propelorm/Propel)

The gitter channel is the preferred way of support requests.

For anything more concrete please open up feature/bug tickets directly at the repository.


## Mailing Lists (Deprecated) ##

In order to ask for support or help other users, use the **Propel Users** mailing-list:

[http://groups.google.com/group/propel-users](http://groups.google.com/group/propel-users)

If you want to help with the development of Propel, or if you want to be informed of the upcoming features, subscribe to the **Propel Development** mailing-list:

[http://groups.google.com/group/propel-development](http://groups.google.com/group/propel-development)

These lists were created in May 2009. A previous set mailing-lists were hosted by tigris.org, you can still consult the archives:

* [Users list archives](http://propel.tigris.org/ds/viewForumSummary.do?dsForumId=1097)
* [Development list archives](http://propel.tigris.org/ds/viewForumSummary.do?dsForumId=1093)


## Bug Reports ##

You can look at the [Propel organization](https://github.com/propelorm) and to report bugs or to ask for new features to the [Propel ticketing system](https://github.com/propelorm/Propel2/issues).
